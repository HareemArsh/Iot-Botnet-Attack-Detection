# Network Traffic Classification with Machine Learning

## Abstract
This report presents a comprehensive analysis of network traffic classification focusing on machine learning models using the N-BaIoT dataset, comprising benign and attack traffic. The methodology involves data processing, model selection, training, and evaluation using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Isolation Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes. Performance metrics are analyzed, providing insights into model effectiveness and limitations.

## Introduction
IoT devices, due to their vulnerabilities, are susceptible to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, making them potential targets for botnet attacks. The increasing prevalence of IoT devices has led to a rise in botnet attacks, posing challenges for detection and mitigation.

## Objectives
The objectives include understanding the N_BaIoT dataset, implementing data mining techniques for botnet attack detection, and evaluating algorithms for real-time monitoring of IoT devices.

## Literature Review
Existing literature on supervised detection of IoT botnet attacks, fuzzy rule interpolation, and machine learning for botnet attack detection in IoT devices serves as the foundation for enhancing detection capabilities.

## Dataset
The N-BaIoT dataset comprises traffic data from nine IoT devices, containing both benign and attack traffic categorized into ten classes of attacks. Statistical features extracted from packet streams provide rich data for analysis.
